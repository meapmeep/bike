            <div class="brands-img">             
              <p>-Trek was founded in 1976 in Waterloo, Wisconsin. It is the largest bike brand in the United States, according to CNBC. Despite the fact that the majority of its production has gone elsewhere, the firm still manufactures some bikes in the United States. As of 2014, it was producing about 25,000 bicycles per year in the United States, accounting for over half of all bicycles made in the country.</p>
              <br>
              <p>-Trek offers a wide variety of bike types at a variety of price points. It manufactures bicycles for men, women, and children, as well as cycling equipment and clothing. Trek makes a number of electric mountain bikes in addition to standard pedal-powered cycles. Bikes range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.</p>

            <h1>•Cannondale</h1>
            <div class="brands-img">
              <p>-Cannondale is a well-known bicycle manufacturer that has been around since the 1970s. Cannonade was born in a Connecticut pickle plant, whereas Trek was formed over a glass of beer by two friends. Initially, the company produced a bike trailer, accessories, and apparel rather than motorcycles.</p>
              <br>
              <p>-The brand's first bike, a touring type, was introduced in 1983. The following year, it released a racing bike. Cannonade made headlines in 1997 by allowing members of the Saeco cycling team (who rode the brand's bike) ride on aluminum frames during the Tour de France. The leader of the Saeco team declared Cannondale bikes to be the best, according to corporate mythology.</p>

            <div class="brands-img">
              <p>-Kona Bikes is a newcomer to the scene. Dan Gerhard and Jacob Heilbron founded the company in 1988. The brand is still owned by the couple, and it is still based in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
              <br>
              <p>-Kona is known for being the first firm to manufacture a straight leg mountain bike fork. The bike was designed in collaboration with Brodie (aka Bruce Spicer). Kona currently offers ten fork models for mountain bikes and road bikes of varying sizes.</p>

            <div class="brands-img">           
              <p>-Bianchi, another Italian bike manufacturer, holds the distinction of being the world's longest continuously operating bicycle firm. It all started in 1885, when 21-year-old Eldoardo Bianchi decided to add a chain to the famed "ordinary" bicycles and reduce the front wheel size.</p>
              <br>
              <p>-His plan appeared to be a success. Bianchi was credited with a number of additional innovations in bicycle design and function throughout the years. In 1913, for example, he invented the first ever front brake.</p>

            <div class="brands-img">
              <p>-Cervelo is another brand that is still in its infancy. It all began in Canada in 1995. The company's mission is straightforward: to develop the world's quickest bike. As a result, whether you're new to riding or looking for a bike for commuting or occasional use, it's probably not a brand you'll look into.</p>
              <br>
              <p>-This might be the brand for you if you constantly feel the urge for speed on your bike, whether you're training for an Ironman or the Tour de France, or simply enjoy a weekend ride. The C series, Series, Series, S series, and T series are the five road bike series offered by Cervelo.</p>
